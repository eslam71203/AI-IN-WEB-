Usage
Running Migrations
To apply database migrations, the run_migrations function in app/run.py will be executed automatically when the application starts.

Authentication
The login endpoint in app/api/v1/endpoints.py allows users to log in and receive a JWT token.
The register_user endpoint in app/api/v1/endpoints.py allows new users to register.
Protected Routes
The protected_route endpoint in app/api/v1/endpoints.py is an example of a protected route that requires a valid JWT token.
Gemini Service
The gemini_response function in app/services/gemini_service.py integrates with the Gemini API to generate responses.
Configuration
Configuration settings are managed in app/core/config.py. Ensure that the .env file contains the necessary environment variables, such as DATABASE_URL and GEMINI_API_KEY.
